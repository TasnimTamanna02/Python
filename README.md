# First Solution
First we create a method named QuestionLaunch which is to launch the question to player, take there answer and give feedback accordingly. As the parameter of the method we use <<**QA>>, which means that from the given arguments it a <<dictionary>> is created on the fly. The parameters of the dictionary has the question, three options and the answer.
Next we start our main program where we initiate the MOneyGained to 0 and launch the first question. If the return value of firstquestion is True, then it increments  MoneyGained by 10000 and launches the second questions. This method uses <<if within if>>
# Second Solution
The first step of creating the QuestionLaunch method remains the same. We make changes in the main program. Here, instead of if within if, we use a <<infinite while loop>> and within it we use <<if-else>> repeatedly for each question launch. If the answer is correct, the process continues. else, it breaks out of the loop and ends the game. The loop ensures that the game continues as long as the user is answering correctly and stops when they make a mistake.
